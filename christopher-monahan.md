### Pictures of a proton: quarks, gluons and hadrons from first principles
 
Understanding in detail the properties of protons and neutrons, two of the
basic building blocks of the visible Universe, has been a long-standing goal
for nuclear physics. The strong nuclear force binds together quarks and gluons
into protons, neutrons and other hadrons, but the nonlinear, strongly-coupled
nature of the strong force makes calculations of hadron properties very
challenging. Recent theoretical developments mean calculations of the internal
structure of hadrons, using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD), have now
become possible. Recent proof-of-principle calculations of generalised parton
distributions, which encode the three-dimensional structure of hadrons, marked
the advent of a new era in lattice QCD calculations. I introduce the ideas that
underpin these developments and summarise some of the most exciting recent
results.
