### Black Holes: The Most Mysterious Objects in the Universe
 
In the last decade black holes have come to center stage in both
theoretical and observational science. Theoretically, they were shown a
half-century ago by Stephen Hawking and others to obey a precise but
still-mysterious set of laws which imply they are paradoxically both the
simplest and most complex objects in the universe. Compelling progress on this
paradox has occurred recently. Observationally, they have finally and
dramatically been seen in the sky, including at LIGO and the Event Horizon
Telescope. Future prospects for progress on both fronts hinge on emergent
symmetries occurring near the black holes. An elementary presentation of aspects
of these topics and their interplay will be given.
