### Opportunities for Dark Matter Searches in Cosmology
 
Understanding the fundamental nature of dark matter is one of the major
challenges facing the physics community today. There are dedicated experimental
efforts to search for dark matter interactions with the Standard Model of
particle physics, but no concrete evidence of such interactions has been
observed. In this talk, I will demonstrate how cosmological and astrophysical
observations offer exciting, new possibilities for understanding dark matter
beyond its gravitational impact. I will describe the effects of dark matter
scattering and annihilation processes in the early Universe and show how
observational data constrain broad classes of dark matter models.
