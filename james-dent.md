### Gravitational Waves and Physics Beyond the Standard Model
 
The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has opened a fantastic new window on
the study of physics beyond the standard model of particle physics and early
universe cosmology. This talk will touch on several theoretical arenas of new
physics that can be explored with gravitational waves including primordial black
holes, superradiance, and first order phase transitions, along with the
relevance of these topics to axions, dark matter, and dark sector physics. A
discussion of current searches and discovery prospects for these intriguing
possibilities at present and future gravitational wave observatories across a
broad range of frequencies will also be given.
