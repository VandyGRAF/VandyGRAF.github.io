 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

#### Alice's adventures with bombs, Bobs, and black holes
 
The harmonization of gravity and quantum mechanics is a major open question in
physics, and the obstacles involve conceptual difficulties surrounding
observables and measurement.  I will give a pedagogical presentation, at the
advanced undergraduate level, of three thought experiments that probe the
relationships between gravity, measurement, and quantum mechanics.  The first
is the Eliztur-Vaidman bomb, which demonstrates "interaction-free measurement"
and has been experimentally realized.  The second is a puzzle due to Mari et
al, whose resolution in Belanchia et al and Danielson-Satischandran-Wald (DSW)
demonstrates that gravitationally mediated entanglement requires a fully
quantized gravitational field (the existence of gravitons), opening the door to
tabletop experimental evidence for quantum gravity.  The third is a
demonstration, also by DSW, that black holes passively decohere external
quantum states, showing that strong gravity regions have a profound influence
even on distant quantum systems.

#### Exotic Matter in Neutron Stars

The high densities achieved in neutron stars and the high densities and
temperatures achieved in neutron-star mergers create ideal testing grounds in
which to learn about exotic matter, namely hyperons and deconfined quarks. The
presence of exotic matter can strongly affect the interior of neutron stars,
but cannot be directly observed. New electromagnetic and gravitational-wave
constraints have been slowly constraining the dense QCD equation of state,
allowing us to learn important information about the strong interaction.
Nevertheless, strong constraints on dense and hot matter depend on (a) the not
yet observed post-merger period of gravitational-wave production from
neutron-star mergers and (b) non-trivial comparisons with particle collision
experimental data. In this talk, I discuss where we stand and what we expect to
learn about dense matter in the near future.
