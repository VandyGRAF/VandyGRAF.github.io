 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

## VandyGRAF Seminar Series

**All VandyGRAF talks will take place in A1013 17th&Horton Seminar room, unless indicated below.**

<hr>

### Nico Yunes, *University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign*
**September 06, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### What lies beyond Einstein when gravity waves?
*Abstract:* Einstein's theory of general relativity has survived all experimental and observational scrutinity to date, yet observational and theoretical anomalies suggest to some that it may not fully capture the nature of reality. What then lies beyond Einstein's masterpiece? Gravitational waves have recently opened a new window into the extreme, where gravity is unfathomly strong and simultaneously dynamical. In this technical seminar, I will explain how we can leverage gravitational waves to probe for physics beyond Einstein at the horizon scales of astrophysical black holes. 

### Robert Scherrer, *Vanderbilt University*
**September 13, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### Cosmological Effects of a Rapidly Varying Gravitational Constant
*Abstract:* Scalar-tensor theories of gravity lead naturally to a time-varying G. The consequences of a rapidly-varying G were first explored by Accetta and Steinhardt in 1991 and then generally ignored. I will discuss the motivation for such models and review the observational limits that can be placed on time-varying G. I will then discuss recent work with Anish Giri (Vanderbilt undergraduate) using big-bang nucleosynthesis to constrain these models. In the second part of talk, I will discuss possible future directions, including models with rapidly-oscillating G that can mimic a cosmological constant. I am hoping that this part of the talk can be an open discussion â€“ there ought to be lots of interesting consequences from a rapidly oscillating value of G that have not been previously examined.

### Joseph Farah, *University of California, Santa Barbara*
**September 20, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### Inferring black hole spin from images of the photon ring
*Abstract:* Measuring the spin of a black hole is crucial for understanding its formation, evolution, and the extreme physics in its vicinity, including the dynamics of accretion disks and relativistic jets. The shadow of a black hole and the photon rings that encircle it are closely tied to the spin of the black hole and serve as a useful proxy for its measurement. Recently, interferometers such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have imaged the shadows of the largest black holes on the sky, and upcoming missions like the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) will probe their horizons and photon rings with unprecedented resolution. In this talk, I will explain how future high-resolution images from EHT+BHEX will be used to measure the photon ring and infer the spin of black hole targets.

### Eliot Quataert, *Princeton University*
**October 4, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
