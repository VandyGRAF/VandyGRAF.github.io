 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

#### Exotic Matter in Neutron Stars

The high densities achieved in neutron stars and the high densities and temperatures achieved in neutron-star mergers create ideal testing grounds in which to learn about exotic matter, namely hyperons and deconfined quarks. The presence of exotic matter can strongly affect the interior of neutron stars, but cannot be directly observed. New electromagnetic and gravitational-wave constraints have been slowly constraining the dense QCD equation of state, allowing us to learn important information about the strong interaction. Nevertheless, strong constraints on dense and hot matter depend on (a) the not yet observed post-merger period of gravitational-wave production from neutron-star mergers and (b) non-trivial comparisons with particle collision experimental data. In this talk, I discuss where we stand and what we expect to learn about dense matter in the near future.
