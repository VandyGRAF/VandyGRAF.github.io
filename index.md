 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

## VandyGRAF Seminar Series

**All VandyGRAF talks will take place in the Chapel in the 17th&Horton building, unless indicated below.**

<hr>

### Joseph Farah, *University of California Santa Barbara*
**September 20, 12:00 pm - 1:30 pm**
##### Inferring black hole spin from images of the photon ring
*Abstract:* Measuring the spin of a black hole is crucial for understanding its formation, evolution, and the extreme physics in its vicinity, including the dynamics of accretion disks and relativistic jets. The shadow of a black hole and the photon rings that encircle it are closely tied to the spin of the black hole and serve as a useful proxy for its measurement. Recently, interferometers such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have imaged the shadows of the largest black holes on the sky, and upcoming missions like the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) will probe their horizons and photon rings with unprecedented resolution. In this talk, I will explain how future high-resolution images from EHT+BHEX will be used to measure the photon ring and infer the spin of black hole targets.

### Eliot Quataert, *Princeton University*
**October 4, 12:00 pm - 1:30 pm**
##### The Fates of Stars Orbiting too Close to Massive Black Holes
*Abstract:* Stars orbiting sufficiently close to massive black holes inevitably inspiral towards the black hole due to gravitational wave radiation. The fate of such stars is subtle and depends on an interplay between tidal heating of the star, mass transfer from the star to the black hole, and collisions between the star and any ambient accretion disk. In this talk, I will describe the possible fates of stars on such orbits and their connection to enigmatic classes of recently discovered recurring transients in galactic nuclei, including partial tidal disruption events and quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs).  I will also discuss the connection between inspiraling stars and other stellar dynamical processes in galactic nuclei, e.g., the orbiting stars observed in the Galactic Center, extreme mass ratio inspirals of compact objects observable by LISA, hyper-velocity stars, and tidal disruption events.
