 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

## VandyGRAF Fall Seminar Series

**All VandyGRAF talks will take place in SC 6333, unless indicated below.**

### Veronica Dexheimer, *Kent State University*
**February 9, 1:00 pm**

#### Exotic Matter in Neutron Stars

The high densities achieved in neutron stars and the high densities and
temperatures achieved in neutron-star mergers create ideal testing grounds in
which to learn about exotic matter, namely hyperons and deconfined quarks. The
presence of exotic matter can strongly affect the interior of neutron stars,
but cannot be directly observed. New electromagnetic and gravitational-wave
constraints have been slowly constraining the dense QCD equation of state,
allowing us to learn important information about the strong interaction.
Nevertheless, strong constraints on dense and hot matter depend on (a) the not
yet observed post-merger period of gravitational-wave production from
neutron-star mergers and (b) non-trivial comparisons with particle collision
experimental data. In this talk, I discuss where we stand and what we expect to
learn about dense matter in the near future.

**February 16, 1:00 pm**

#### Mysterious Black holes, Cosmology, and current state of AI in gravitational waves. 

Our understanding of the formation channels of stellar mass compact objects
have been challenged by the discovery of massive binary black holes in the
third observing run of LIGO/Virgo Collaboration.  It is imaginable that our
theories of supermassive black hole formation should be revisited by the launch
of LISA that targets gravitational wave observations of supermassive black
holes at high redshifts.  I will start by discussing potential solutions to
some of the puzzles in massive binary black holes observed by LIGO.  I will
then talk about how we can leverage LISA observations to constrain models of
supermassive black hole formation together with the expansion rate of the
universe at high redshift.  Lastly I will dive into where do we stand with the
application of AI towards classification of gravitational waves and what is the
path forward.
