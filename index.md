 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

##### Relativistic stochastic hydrodynamics: a metropolis approach
*Abstract:* First I will briefly review simulations of dynamical critical phenomena used to study the O(4) critical point in QCD. The numerical approach is based on a symplectic step which preserves the phase space, and a dissipative step based on the metropolis algorithm.  This is a prototype for all dissipative stochastic systems based on an action and entropy principle.<br>

Then I discuss how the approach can be generalized to relativistic fluid dynamics.  I first discuss the advection diffusion equation, presenting numerical results.  Then I indicate how the approach can be generalized to relativistic stochastic hydrodynamics  in a general coordinate system. A virtue of the approach is that there are no non-hydrodynamic modes, or additional variables. The dynamics is stable causal, although only strictly Lorentz invariant to the order of accuracy of hydrodynamics.
