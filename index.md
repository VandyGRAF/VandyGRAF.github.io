 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

#### Neutron star mergers: From gravity to nuclear and plasma physics

Announcing the dawn of a new era of multi-messenger astrophysics, the
gravitational wave event GW170817 – involving the collision of two neutron
stars – was detected in 2017. In addition to the gravitational wave signal, it
was accompanied by electromagnetic counterparts providing new windows into the
different physics probed by the system. Since then, several gravitational wave
events involving neutron stars have been discovered, with many more expected
over the next years. To understand and interpret the physics of these events,
it is necessary to model the intricate dynamics of such systems before, during
and after the merger, including the amplification of strong magnetic fields and
the formation of hot and dense nuclear matter. Due to its strong non-linear
nature, a modeling of the post-merger phase will only be possible with
cutting-edge numerical approaches that combine strong gravity, nuclear physics,
and plasma astrophysics. In this talk, I will discuss recent advances in the
multi-physics modeling of a neutron star coalescence. With the help of several
examples, I will show how future gravitational wave detections of the
post-merger phase might allow to systematically uncover the properties of hot
dense matter. Along those lines, I will also show how neutrino-driven viscosity
can naturally arise during the collision. Lastly, I will show how cutting-edge
numerical simulations can help to uncover new mechanisms for the production
fast radio precursors emitted shortly before the collision of two neutron
stars. I will conclude by discussing how such a multi-physics approach will
enable a next generation modeling of the engines of multi-messenger
gravitational events.

#### Exotic Matter in Neutron Stars

The high densities achieved in neutron stars and the high densities and
temperatures achieved in neutron-star mergers create ideal testing grounds in
which to learn about exotic matter, namely hyperons and deconfined quarks. The
presence of exotic matter can strongly affect the interior of neutron stars,
but cannot be directly observed. New electromagnetic and gravitational-wave
constraints have been slowly constraining the dense QCD equation of state,
allowing us to learn important information about the strong interaction.
Nevertheless, strong constraints on dense and hot matter depend on (a) the not
yet observed post-merger period of gravitational-wave production from
neutron-star mergers and (b) non-trivial comparisons with particle collision
experimental data. In this talk, I discuss where we stand and what we expect to
learn about dense matter in the near future.
