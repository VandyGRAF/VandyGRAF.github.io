 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

### Daniel Mayerson, *Leuven University*
**October 20, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### Fuzzballs in String Theory and Black Hole Observations
*Abstract:* What signatures of string theory can be revealed through precision black hole observations?<br>
Recent strong gravity observations (gravitational waves, black hole imaging) can carry signatures of how general relativity is corrected by quantum effects. In particular, we can distinguish two separate questions:<br>
1) Do (exotic) ultracompact objects exist beyond black holes (and neutron stars)?<br>
2) Are there observable effects of quantum corrections to black hole horizons?<br>
I will discuss these questions and the possible answers from string theory from the viewpoint of the "fuzzball" paradigm, where classical black hole paradoxes are resolved by replacing the horizon by quantum, stringy microstructure. The properties of such microstructure differ from properties of black hole horizons in possibly observable ways and can give rise to exciting predictions for the future of strong gravity observations.

### Chandrodoy Chattopadhyay, *North Carolina State University*
**October 27, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**

### Ken Olum, *Tufts University*
**November 3, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### Cosmic strings and their gravitational waves
*Abstract:* Our universe may contain a network of cosmic strings arising from inflation or a phase transition early in the universe.  Cosmic string loops would produce a gravitational wave background that might be detected by pulsar timing arrays or interferometers.  I will describe how we determine cosmic string network properties and the resulting gravitational wave background for comparison with observation.

### Gabriel Soares Rocha, *Vanderbilt University*
**November 10, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### First order relativistic dissipative hydrodynamic theories from Kinetic Theory
*Abstract:* The study of heavy ion collisions has stimulated research on the emergence of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics from a microscopic theory and its domain of applicability. In particular,  hydrodynamic theories can be derived employing relativistic Kinetic Theory as the microscopic formalism. In this context, the Chapman-Enskog procedure leads to the traditional Navier-Stokes (NS) theory. However, NS is acausal and unstable in the relativistic regime. Usually hydrodynamic models in heavy ion collisions employ Israel-Stewart-like formalisms for the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma. They are conditionally causal and stable, but present a complex PDE structure. Recently, Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun (BDNK) has been proposed. BDNK theory possesses similarities with NS, but the employment of alternative definitions of the local equilibrium state and the presence of time-like derivatives in the constitutive relations are essential render it causal, linearly stable, and strongly hyperbolic. In this talk, we shall discuss the Chapman-Enskog procedure and the modified Chapman-Enskog procedure to derive BDNK, presenting some results in toy-models used in Heavy-Ions collisions as an application.

### Abhishek Hegade, *University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign*
**November 17, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### Probing dissipative effects in neutron stars using gravitational waves
*Abstract:* Tidal interactions in binary neutron star systems allow us to extract information about the equation of state inside a neutron star from gravitational wave observations. In this talk, we discuss how one could potentially probe out-of-equilibrium effects inside a neutron star by modeling the effects of tidal dissipation during the inspiral of a binary neutron star system. To account for dissipative effects such as viscosity, we introduce a new dissipative tidal deformability parameter and show that this term contributes to the gravitational wave phase at the 4th post-Newtonian (PN) order for quasi-circular binaries. This contribution receives a large finite-size enhancement by the stellar compactness, analogous to the case of the tidal deformability, which makes the parameter potentially measurable with ground-based gravitational wave detectors. In this talk, we will discuss our derivation of this result and then discuss our ongoing work on computing the impact of shear and bulk viscosity on the dissipative tidal deformability of neutron stars in general relativity.
