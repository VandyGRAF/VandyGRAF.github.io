 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

### Leonardo Abbrescia, *Vanderbilt University*
**April 5, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### The mathematics of shockwaves
*Abstract:* Shockwaves are very prevalent in physical phenomena: supernova explosions, high-energy particle collisions, condensed matter under extreme conditions, etc. From these situations, one might intuitively think that there is some violent mechanism driving a shock. In this talk, we will see how the mathematics of shock waves proves that this is not the case. For the PDEs that model many of the physical systems we care about, shock waves can form in finite time even for small and completely smooth initial conditions. Moreover, the state variables are bounded at the initial shock singularity. Most of the talk will focus on Burgers’ equation and 1D compressible isentropic Euler, but we will discuss more recent work if time permits.

### David Garfinkle, *Oakland University*
**April 12, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### Gravitational wave memory and its electromagnetic analog
*Abstract:* Gravitational waves stretch and squeeze space, but even when the wave has passed there is a residual stretch and squeeze known as gravitational wave memory.  This memory is a consequence of the nonlinear Einstein field equations, but can be most easily understood by using linear perturbation theory.  Furthermore this linear perturbative treatment is best understood by using manifestly gauge invariant variables: in this case the Weyl tensor.  Gravitational perturbation theory using the Weyl tensor is analogous to Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism.  Correspondingly, there is an electromagnetic analog of gravitational wave memory called electromagnetic memory. I will present a proposal for how to measure electromagnetic memory.

### Grisha Tarnopolsky, *Carnegie Mellon University*
**April 19, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### Density Matrix Renormalization Group approach to two-dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics
*Abstract:* In this talk, I will discuss an application of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) technique to the 1+1-dimensional Schwinger model. First, I will give an elementary review of the conventional renormalization group approach, followed by an accessible introduction to the DMRG technique. Then, I will discuss how it can be applied to field theory, particularly in the simple example the Schwinger model.
