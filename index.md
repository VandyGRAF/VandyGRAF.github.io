 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

##### Exact expectation values in relativistic fluids with rotation and acceleration
*Abstract:* In special relativity, the most general equilibrium state is characterized by a constant angular velocity and/or acceleration. These kinds of states can approximately describe several systems, including the vortical Quark-Gluon Plasma created in heavy ion collisions. In this talk, I will present a framework to compute expectation values in relativistic fluids at global thermodynamic equilibrium with rotation and acceleration. Utilizing an iterative method and analytic continuation, I will derive exact expressions for the Wigner function, conserved currents, spin density matrix, and spin polarization vector. I will explore the phenomenological implications of these findings, addressing the polarization of the Î› hyperon in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
