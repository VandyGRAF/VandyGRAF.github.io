 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

## VandyGRAF Seminar Series

### Nico Yunes, *University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign*
**September 06, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### What lies beyond Einstein when gravity waves?
*Abstract:* Einstein's theory of general relativity has survived all experimental and observational scrutinity to date, yet observational and theoretical anomalies suggest to some that it may not fully capture the nature of reality. What then lies beyond Einstein's masterpiece? Gravitational waves have recently opened a new window into the extreme, where gravity is unfathomly strong and simultaneously dynamical. In this technical seminar, I will explain how we can leverage gravitational waves to probe for physics beyond Einstein at the horizon scales of astrophysical black holes.
