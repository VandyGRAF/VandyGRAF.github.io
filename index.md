 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

##### Probing dissipative effects in neutron stars using gravitational waves
*Abstract:* Tidal interactions in binary neutron star systems allow us to extract information about the equation of state inside a neutron star from gravitational wave observations. In this talk, we discuss how one could potentially probe out-of-equilibrium effects inside a neutron star by modeling the effects of tidal dissipation during the inspiral of a binary neutron star system. To account for dissipative effects such as viscosity, we introduce a new dissipative tidal deformability parameter and show that this term contributes to the gravitational wave phase at the 4th post-Newtonian (PN) order for quasi-circular binaries. This contribution receives a large finite-size enhancement by the stellar compactness, analogous to the case of the tidal deformability, which makes the parameter potentially measurable with ground-based gravitational wave detectors. In this talk, we will discuss our derivation of this result and then discuss our ongoing work on computing the impact of shear and bulk viscosity on the dissipative tidal deformability of neutron stars in general relativity.

##### Stochastic fluctuations in relativistic fluids: causality, stability, and the information current
*Abstract:* The study of the quark-gluon plasma in high-energy nuclear physics has generated significant research into relativistic fluid dynamics. While hydrodynamic simulations have been used to model various phenomena in heavy-ion collisions, the commonly used formulations are incomplete, as they are inconsistent with basic thermodynamic principles. In particular, they lack the thermal fluctuations necessary to ensure the system realizes the correct equilibrium distribution. In this talk, I will discuss a new means of modeling thermal fluctuations in relativistic systems that ensure that the correlators are independent of the choice of spacetime foliation. This formulation is constructed using the recently developed information current, which is instrumental when studying causality and stability in relativistic systems. By using the information current to describe fluctuations, this formulation builds constraints associated with these effects directly into the modeling. Using this new method of describing fluctuating relativistic systems, we will construct an effective action and show that a fluctuation-dissipation relation can be realized in this action through a symmetry associated with detailed balance.
