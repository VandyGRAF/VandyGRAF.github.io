 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

##### Cosmic strings and their gravitational waves
*Abstract:* Our universe may contain a network of cosmic strings arising from inflation or a phase transition early in the universe.  Cosmic string loops would produce a gravitational wave background that might be detected by pulsar timing arrays or interferometers.  I will describe how we determine cosmic string network properties and the resulting gravitational wave background for comparison with observation.

### Roman Berens, *Vanderbilt University*

**November 17, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### Probing dissipative effects in neutron stars using gravitational waves
*Abstract:* Tidal interactions in binary neutron star systems allow us to extract information about the equation of state inside a neutron star from gravitational wave observations. In this talk, we discuss how one could potentially probe out-of-equilibrium effects inside a neutron star by modeling the effects of tidal dissipation during the inspiral of a binary neutron star system. To account for dissipative effects such as viscosity, we introduce a new dissipative tidal deformability parameter and show that this term contributes to the gravitational wave phase at the 4th post-Newtonian (PN) order for quasi-circular binaries. This contribution receives a large finite-size enhancement by the stellar compactness, analogous to the case of the tidal deformability, which makes the parameter potentially measurable with ground-based gravitational wave detectors. In this talk, we will discuss our derivation of this result and then discuss our ongoing work on computing the impact of shear and bulk viscosity on the dissipative tidal deformability of neutron stars in general relativity.
