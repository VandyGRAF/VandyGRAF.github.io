 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

#### Pictures of a proton: quarks, gluons and hadrons from first principles
 
Understanding in detail the properties of protons and neutrons, two of the
basic building blocks of the visible Universe, has been a long-standing goal
for nuclear physics. The strong nuclear force binds together quarks and gluons
into protons, neutrons and other hadrons, but the nonlinear, strongly-coupled
nature of the strong force makes calculations of hadron properties very
challenging. Recent theoretical developments mean calculations of the internal
structure of hadrons, using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD), have now
become possible. Recent proof-of-principle calculations of generalised parton
distributions, which encode the three-dimensional structure of hadrons, marked
the advent of a new era in lattice QCD calculations. I introduce the ideas that
underpin these developments and summarise some of the most exciting recent
results.

#### Exotic Matter in Neutron Stars

The high densities achieved in neutron stars and the high densities and
temperatures achieved in neutron-star mergers create ideal testing grounds in
which to learn about exotic matter, namely hyperons and deconfined quarks. The
presence of exotic matter can strongly affect the interior of neutron stars,
but cannot be directly observed. New electromagnetic and gravitational-wave
constraints have been slowly constraining the dense QCD equation of state,
allowing us to learn important information about the strong interaction.
Nevertheless, strong constraints on dense and hot matter depend on (a) the not
yet observed post-merger period of gravitational-wave production from
neutron-star mergers and (b) non-trivial comparisons with particle collision
experimental data. In this talk, I discuss where we stand and what we expect to
learn about dense matter in the near future.
