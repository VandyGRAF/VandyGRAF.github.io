 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

## VandyGRAF Seminar Series

### Grisha Tarnopolsky, *Carnegie Mellon University*
**April 19, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### Density Matrix Renormalization Group approach to two-dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics
*Abstract:* In this talk, I will discuss an application of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) technique to the 1+1-dimensional Schwinger model. First, I will give an elementary review of the conventional renormalization group approach, followed by an accessible introduction to the DMRG technique. Then, I will discuss how it can be applied to field theory, particularly in the simple example the Schwinger model.
