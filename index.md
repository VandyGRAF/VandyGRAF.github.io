 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

## VandyGRAF Seminar Series

**All VandyGRAF talks will take place in SC 6333, unless indicated below.**

<hr>

### Jess McIver, *University of British Columbia*
**February 16, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### New frontiers in gravitational-wave astrophysics
*Abstract:* The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration is currently in the middle of its fourth observing run. The two LIGO detectors in the US have enabled a high rate of candidate gravitational-wave detections from compact object mergers - roughly one every few days - with unprecedented detector sensitivities. In addition to providing a high rate of extragalactic gravitational-wave sources, the improved sensitivity of the LIGO detectors has enhanced the possibility of a first galactic detection of gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars.<br>

I will introduce a new search method for galactic “continuous” gravitational wave sources that leverages the Viterbi algorithm. I will also discuss the challenges for extracting a high rate of gravitational-wave signals from detector data and a new machine learning method to automatically identify non-stationary detector noise overlapping with candidate events in order to improve the accuracy of source property estimation.

### Andrea Palermo, *Stony Brook University*
**February 23, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### Exact expectation values in relativistic fluids with rotation and acceleration
*Abstract:* In special relativity, the most general equilibrium state is characterized by a constant angular velocity and/or acceleration. These kinds of states can approximately describe several systems, including the vortical Quark-Gluon Plasma created in heavy ion collisions. In this talk, I will present a framework to compute expectation values in relativistic fluids at global thermodynamic equilibrium with rotation and acceleration. Utilizing an iterative method and analytic continuation, I will derive exact expressions for the Wigner function, conserved currents, spin density matrix, and spin polarization vector. I will explore the phenomenological implications of these findings, addressing the polarization of the Λ hyperon in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
