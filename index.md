 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

### Smadar Naoz, *University of California Los Angeles*
**January 19, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### New developments in the three-body problem and gravitational wave at the heart of galaxies
*Abstract:* Many observed triple systems in our Universe are hierarchical: two objects orbit each other in a relatively tight inner binary while the third object is on a much wider orbit. In this case, the secular approximation (i.e., phase-averaged, long-term evolution) can be applied, where the interactions between two non-resonant orbits are equivalent to treating the two orbits as massive wires. Thus, the orbits may change shape and orientation on timescales longer than the orbital periods, but the semi-major axes are constant. This approximation has been proven to be very useful in many astrophysical contexts, from planetary to triple-star systems and even black holes. I will discuss recent developments in that field and will show that hierarchical triple systems are richer and far more exciting than considered before. In particular, the tight orbit can reach extremely high eccentricities and undergo chaotic flips of its orientation. This behavior has important implications for the evolution of many systems, and I will present some seminal examples focusing on gravitational wave emission. Particularly, the recent detection of gravitational-wave emission from merging stellar-mass black holes (BH) and Neutron stars by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) transformed how we sense our Universe. However, it remains challenging to explain the formation channels of these sources. In this talk, I will show that the dense environments of stars and stellar remnants surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBH) can naturally yield such gravitational wave mergers, consistent with LIGO detections.

### Pavel Kovtun, *University of Victoria*
**January 26, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### Relativistic fluids and quasinormal modes
*Abstract:* I will talk about the difficulty of incorporating viscous effects in relativistic fluids, and how studying quasinormal modes of black holes may help solve the problem.
