 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

### Andrea Palermo, *Stony Brook University*
**February 23, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### Exact expectation values in relativistic fluids with rotation and acceleration
*Abstract:* In special relativity, the most general equilibrium state is characterized by a constant angular velocity and/or acceleration. These kinds of states can approximately describe several systems, including the vortical Quark-Gluon Plasma created in heavy ion collisions. In this talk, I will present a framework to compute expectation values in relativistic fluids at global thermodynamic equilibrium with rotation and acceleration. Utilizing an iterative method and analytic continuation, I will derive exact expressions for the Wigner function, conserved currents, spin density matrix, and spin polarization vector. I will explore the phenomenological implications of these findings, addressing the polarization of the Î› hyperon in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

### Deborah Ferguson, *University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign*
**March 1, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**

### Paul Romatschke, *University of Colorado Boulder*
**March 8, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### An Upper Bound on the Speed of Sound in Neutron Stars
*Abstract:* Resummed Second Order Relativistic Fluid Dynamics (aka Israel-Stewart Theory) is the workhorse for simulating viscous relativistic fluids for high energy nuclear collisions. It has long been known that resummed fluid dynamics obeys causality if the ratio of first and second order transport coefficients (e.g. shear viscosity over shear relaxation time) are bounded from above. In this talk, I point out that inverting this logic leads to an upper bound on the speed of sound from transport and causality, specifically c_s^2 < 0.781. All currently known first-principles calculations for cold nuclear matter obey this bound. Using this bound as input for the ultradense matter EoS implies that the maximum mass of neutron stars cannot exceed 2.7 solar masses.
