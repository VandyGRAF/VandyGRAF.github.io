 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

##### Convergence of hydrodynamics in rapidly spinning strongly coupled plasma
*Abstract:* We compute the radius of convergence of the linearized relativistic hydrodynamic expansion around a non-trivially rotating strongly coupled N=4 Super-Yang-Mills plasma. Our results show that the validity of hydrodynamics is sustained and can even get enhanced in highly vortical plasmas, such as the ones produced in heavy-ion collisions. The hydrodynamic dispersion relations are computed using a rotating background that is an analytic solution of the ideal hydrodynamic equations of motion with non-vanishing angular momentum and large vorticity gradients. In the large temperature limit, this gives rise to a particularly convenient boost symmetry. That symmetry allows to derive analytic equations for the transport coefficients of the rotating plasma as a function of their values in a plasma at rest.

### Clifford Will, *University of Florida*
**February 9, 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm**
##### Adventures of a General Relativist in a Three-body World
*Abstract:* The Newtonian three-body problem has a history that goes back to Newton, and continues to be relevant today. Following a brief history of the problem, we focus on hierarchical triple systems, in which an inner binary is perturbed by a distant body. This problem is amenable to a perturbative expansion in powers of the ratio of the two semimajor axes. We will review some of the remarkable phenomena that occur at various orders in the expansion, such as the famous Kozai-Lidov oscillations at quadrupole order and orbital flips at octupole order, and will discuss our own work to push the expansion to and beyond hexadecapole order. At dotriocontopole order, a new class of effects arises from the second-order interaction of quadrupole terms, affecting systems where the third body is much more massive than the inner binary. When GR corrections are introduced, additional effects occur, including suppression of Kozai-Lidov oscillations, and new contributions to Mercuryâ€™s perihelion advance, potentially detectable by the current Bepi-Colombo mission.
