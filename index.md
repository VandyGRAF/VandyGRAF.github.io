 The Vanderbilt Initiative  for Gravity, Waves, and Fluids is an interdisciplinary research venture  providing mathematicians, physicists, and astrophysicists with the resources and space to connect and collaboratively work on problems of outstanding scientific merit, such as:

+ General relativity: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, black holes, gravitational radiation, and multimessenger astrophysics.
+ Fluid mechanics: theoretical, mathematical, numerical, or experimental, including, but not restricted to, relativistic fluids far from equilibrium.
+ Evolution of partial differential equations related to fluids and gravity, including, but not restricted to, the geometric analysis of waves and fluids.
+ The physics and mathematics of neutron star mergers and high-energy nuclear collisions.

#### Gravitational waves from black hole mergers: The big picture and subtle details

Extracting science from gravitational wave observations requires theoretical modeling, both analytical and numerical. The current state of these models is sufficient for present-day detectors, but next generation detectors bring the promise and challenge of much higher signal-to-noise ratios. This demands we understand the fine details: our modeling errors must be smaller than statistical noise. I'll give an overview of modeling gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers, then go into some of the subtle details: (i) The beginnings of our numerical waveforms need to be stitched to analytical approximations; and (ii) The late portion of our numerical waveforms can be modeled as "quasinormal ringing." Getting both of these right is harder than it sounds!

#### Portrait of a Black Hole
The Event Horizon Telescope images of M87* and Sgr A* have
opened a new era of resolved imaging of black holes at the event
horizon scale.  I will describe how EHT measurements are made,
how they can be interpreted with the aid of state-of-the-art models,
what they teach us about black holes, and what the prospects are for
future experiments.

#### Celestial Holography

The formulation of a complete theory of quantum gravity remains a fundamental open problem in modern physics. Meaningful progress has arisen from concrete realizations of the holographic principle, which is a conjectured equivalence between systems of quantum gravity and ordinary non-gravitational systems in fewer dimensions. At present, this principle is best understood in the context of negatively-curved spacetimes. Celestial holography -- the subject of this lecture -- is a novel extension of the holographic approach to the asymptotically flat context. More specifically, it is a proposed equivalence between gravitational scattering in asymptotically flat spacetimes and a conformal field theory living on the celestial sphere. Remarkably, the process of so-reformulating the physics has unearthed new structure that underlies the gravitational scattering problem. Notably, gravitational scattering admits an infinite-dimensional symmetry, which has been now identified as the w(1+infinity) symmetry that has previously appeared in other two-dimensional physical systems. These symmetries imply an infinite number of constraints on scattering amplitudes, which physically enforce universal behavior in the infrared.

#### Exotic Matter in Neutron Stars

The high densities achieved in neutron stars and the high densities and temperatures achieved in neutron-star mergers create ideal testing grounds in which to learn about exotic matter, namely hyperons and deconfined quarks. The presence of exotic matter can strongly affect the interior of neutron stars, but cannot be directly observed. New electromagnetic and gravitational-wave constraints have been slowly constraining the dense QCD equation of state, allowing us to learn important information about the strong interaction. Nevertheless, strong constraints on dense and hot matter depend on (a) the not yet observed post-merger period of gravitational-wave production from neutron-star mergers and (b) non-trivial comparisons with particle collision experimental data. In this talk, I discuss where we stand and what we expect to learn about dense matter in the near future.
