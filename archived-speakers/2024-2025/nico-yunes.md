### What lies beyond Einstein when gravity waves?

Einstein's theory of general relativity has survived all experimental and observational scrutinity to date, yet observational and theoretical anomalies suggest to some that it may not fully capture the nature of reality. What then lies beyond Einstein's masterpiece? Gravitational waves have recently opened a new window into the extreme, where gravity is unfathomly strong and simultaneously dynamical. In this technical seminar, I will explain how we can leverage gravitational waves to probe for physics beyond Einstein at the horizon scales of astrophysical black holes.
