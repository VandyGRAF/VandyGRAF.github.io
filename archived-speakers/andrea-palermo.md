### Exact expectation values in relativistic fluids with rotation and acceleration

In special relativity, the most general equilibrium state is characterized by a constant angular velocity and/or acceleration. These kinds of states can approximately describe several systems, including the vortical Quark-Gluon Plasma created in heavy ion collisions. In this talk, I will present a framework to compute expectation values in relativistic fluids at global thermodynamic equilibrium with rotation and acceleration. Utilizing an iterative method and analytic continuation, I will derive exact expressions for the Wigner function, conserved currents, spin density matrix, and spin polarization vector. I will explore the phenomenological implications of these findings, addressing the polarization of the Î› hyperon in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
