### Portrait of a Black Hole

The Event Horizon Telescope images of M87* and Sgr A* have opened a new era of resolved imaging of black holes at the event horizon scale. I will describe how EHT measurements are made, how they can be interpreted with the aid of state-of-the-art models, what they teach us about black holes, and what the prospects are for future experiments.
