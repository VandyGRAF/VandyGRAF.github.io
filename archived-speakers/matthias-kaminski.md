### Convergence of hydrodynamics in rapidly spinning strongly coupled plasma

We compute the radius of convergence of the linearized relativistic hydrodynamic expansion around a non-trivially rotating strongly coupled N=4 Super-Yang-Mills plasma. Our results show that the validity of hydrodynamics is sustained and can even get enhanced in highly vortical plasmas, such as the ones produced in heavy-ion collisions. The hydrodynamic dispersion relations are computed using a rotating background that is an analytic solution of the ideal hydrodynamic equations of motion with non-vanishing angular momentum and large vorticity gradients. In the large temperature limit, this gives rise to a particularly convenient boost symmetry. That symmetry allows to derive analytic equations for the transport coefficients of the rotating plasma as a function of their values in a plasma at rest.
