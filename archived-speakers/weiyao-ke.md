### Extending the hydrodynamic description of the quark-gluon plasma

The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a hot and dense state of matter governed by the
quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Like many other QCD systems, QGP displays
different properties when probed at different length scales. At long
wavelengths or small gradients, it turns out to be a nearly perfect liquid;
while at short distances, one expects to resolve quarks and gluons in the
plasma. However, the dynamics at the intermediate length scale and how it
transits from hydrodynamic to microscopic excitations are relatively less
discussed. Recently, we noticed that in both weakly-coupled and
strongly-coupled proxy theories of the QGP, sound modes continue to dominate
the response at large wavenumbers, way beyond the traditional hydrodynamic
region. I will demonstrate how we extend the Muller-Israel-Stewart hydrodynamic
equations to describe such "sound dominance" of the linear response of the
system at large gradients. Finally, I will discuss possible phenomenological
applications in heavy-ion collisions.
