### Cosmic strings and their gravitational waves

Our universe may contain a network of cosmic strings arising from inflation or a phase transition early in the universe.  Cosmic string loops would produce a gravitational wave background that might be detected by pulsar timing arrays or interferometers.  I will describe how we determine cosmic string network properties and the resulting gravitational wave background for comparison with observation.
