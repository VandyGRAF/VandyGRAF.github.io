### Numerical Relativity for Next-Generation Gravitational-Wave Observation

With LIGO's fourth observing run already underway, gravitational wave observations are becoming significantly louder and more frequent. As we look toward O5 and next-generation observatories such as Cosmic Explorer and LISA, signal-to-noise ratios will reach into the hundreds and possibly thousands. This brings incredible opportunities to study gravity at its strongest, but the loud, overlapping signals also lead to more stringent requirements on waveform modeling. To fully capitalize on this wealth of data, we need accurate waveforms that densely cover the parameter space. In this talk, I will discuss our efforts to prepare numerical relativity for the exciting opportunities that are to come.
