### Density Matrix Renormalization Group approach to two-dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics

In this talk, I will discuss an application of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) technique to the 1+1-dimensional Schwinger model. First, I will give an elementary review of the conventional renormalization group approach, followed by an accessible introduction to the DMRG technique. Then, I will discuss how it can be applied to field theory, particularly in the simple example the Schwinger model.
