### Black Hole Shadows and Photon Rings: Experimental Relativity with Radio Interferometry

By combining global networks of radio telescopes, very long baseline
interferometry provides the sharpest images in astronomy. This technique has
recently culminated in the first images of a black hole, produced using the
Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). These images revealed dark "shadows" encircled by
bright and unresolved rings for the nuclear supermassive black holes in M87 and
the Milky Way. I will discuss these results, including their implications for
astrophysical theories of black hole accretion and jet formation. I will then
describe our efforts to develop the next-generation EHT (ngEHT) and a
space-enhanced EHT over the coming decade, which will improve the dynamic range
of current EHT images by two orders of magnitude and will enable studies of
horizon-scale dynamics through black hole movies. These efforts can resolve the
fractal substructure from unstable photon orbits near a black hole that is
predicted to appear within the blurry EHT ring, and they will ultimately measure
the masses of thousands of supermassive black holes across cosmic history.
