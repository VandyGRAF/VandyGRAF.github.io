### Science in the White House
 
Increasingly, for many public issues, good science is essential to the creation
of good policy. What are the mechanisms for informing and advising government
policy-makers, from the President of the United States on down, about
science--especially for rapidly changing fields such as artificial intelligence,
clean energy, and health-related technology? Within the White House, science
advice comes from a full-time Science Advisor and staff, and from the
President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), a group of
Presidentially appointed outsiders. I was privileged to be one of these on
President Obama's PCAST for eight years, and now serve on President Biden's
PCAST. My talk will discuss the commonalities and differences between these two
administrations, how and why PCAST achieved success on some issues, but was
ineffective on others.
