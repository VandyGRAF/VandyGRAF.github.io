### Black holes, cosmology, and quantum entanglement
 
Stephen Hawking's black hole information paradox is a conflict between
gravity and quantum mechanics, and it has been both a crisis and a guiding light
for theoretical physicists for over 40 years. I will describe recent work
showing that wormholes in quantum gravity lead to a new formula for entropy  --
this formula corrects Hawking's and is consistent with both gravity and quantum
mechanics. Tools from quantum information science then imply the surprising idea
that we can manipulate the interior of a black hole from the safety of our
laboratory, without ever jumping in. I will end by using this new paradigm to
provide an example of such nonlocal connections in cosmology.
