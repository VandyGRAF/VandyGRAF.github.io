### Relativistic Fluid Dynamics: From Particle Colliders to Neutron Star Mergers
 
Heavy-ion collision experiments have provided overwhelming evidence that quarks
and gluons, the elementary particles within protons and neutrons, can flow as a
nearly frictionless, strongly interacting relativistic liquid over distance
scales not much larger than the size of a proton. On the other hand, with the
dawn of the multi-messenger astronomy era marked by the detection of a binary
neutron star merger, it became imperative to understand how extremely dense
fluids behave under very strong gravitational fields. Therefore, cutting-edge
experimental apparatus in modern science, such as the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC), the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) are now taking data whose description
requires pushing the boundaries of our current understanding of fluid dynamics.
In this talk I will discuss the new developments that have contributed to
redefine the onset of relativistic fluid dynamics and its extension towards the
far-from- equilibrium regime. New results involving viscous fluids and their
coupling to general relativity will also be presented. These developments pave
the way for the inclusion of viscous effects in neutron star merger
simulations.
