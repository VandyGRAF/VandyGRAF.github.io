### The Black Hole Photon Ring, Old and New

The black hole photon ring is a prime target for upcoming space-based VLBI
missions seeking to image the fine structure of astrophysical black holes. The
photon ring controls a surprising number of observational signatures relevant to
both current and future gravitational experiments. Its intricate, nested subring
structure predicts distinct interferometric signatures in black hole images, and
the ring also controls an interesting sector of the black holeâ€™s quasinormal
mode spectrum. Semiclassical analysis also suggests an important role for the
photon ring in the (still mysterious) quantum mechanical description of the Kerr
black hole. If time permits, I will also discuss a number of recently discovered
emergent symmetries related to the intricate self-similar structure of the
photon ring.
