### Mysterious Black holes, Cosmology, and current state of AI in gravitational waves. 

Our understanding of the formation channels of stellar mass compact objects
have been challenged by the discovery of massive binary black holes in the
third observing run of LIGO/Virgo Collaboration.  It is imaginable that our
theories of supermassive black hole formation should be revisited by the launch
of LISA that targets gravitational wave observations of supermassive black
holes at high redshifts.  I will start by discussing potential solutions to
some of the puzzles in massive binary black holes observed by LIGO.  I will
then talk about how we can leverage LISA observations to constrain models of
supermassive black hole formation together with the expansion rate of the
universe at high redshift.  Lastly I will dive into where do we stand with the
application of AI towards classification of gravitational waves and what is the
path forward.
