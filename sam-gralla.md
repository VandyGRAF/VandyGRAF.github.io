### Alice's adventures with bombs, Bobs, and black holes
 
The harmonization of gravity and quantum mechanics is a major open question in
physics, and the obstacles involve conceptual difficulties surrounding
observables and measurement.  I will give a pedagogical presentation, at the
advanced undergraduate level, of three thought experiments that probe the
relationships between gravity, measurement, and quantum mechanics.  The first
is the Eliztur-Vaidman bomb, which demonstrates "interaction-free measurement"
and has been experimentally realized.  The second is a puzzle due to Mari et
al, whose resolution in Belanchia et al and Danielson-Satischandran-Wald (DSW)
demonstrates that gravitationally mediated entanglement requires a fully
quantized gravitational field (the existence of gravitons), opening the door to
tabletop experimental evidence for quantum gravity.  The third is a
demonstration, also by DSW, that black holes passively decohere external
quantum states, showing that strong gravity regions have a profound influence
even on distant quantum systems.
